# Green Phase - Make Test Pass

Implement the minimum code to make the failing test pass:

1. Write the simplest code that could possibly work
2. Don't worry about duplication or design yet
3. Run all tests to verify they pass
4. Do NOT refactor until tests are green
5. Only write enough code to satisfy the current test

Remember: The goal is to get to green quickly, not to write perfect code.

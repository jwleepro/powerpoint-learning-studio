# Find Next Test

Find and display the next unmarked test from plan.md:

1. Read the plan.md file
2. Locate the next test that hasn't been marked complete
3. Display the test description and requirements
4. Suggest what kind of test to write first
5. Ask if ready to proceed with writing the failing test

This helps maintain focus on incremental development.

# Go Command

Find the next unmarked test in plan.md and implement it following TDD principles:

1. Read plan.md to find the next unmarked test
2. Write a failing test that defines the behavior
3. Run the test to verify it fails (Red phase)
4. Implement the minimum code needed to make the test pass
5. Run all tests to verify they pass (Green phase)
6. Consider if refactoring is needed
7. Mark the test as complete in plan.md
8. If there are any project structure, directory, or file additions/deletions/modifications, please apply them to Senera MCP memory.

Follow the Red → Green → Refactor cycle strictly.

# Commit Changes

Create a commit following TDD discipline:

1. Verify ALL tests are passing
2. Verify NO compiler/linter warnings exist
3. Verify the change represents a single logical unit
4. Determine commit type:
   - "test:" for new tests
   - "feat:" for behavioral changes
   - "refactor:" for structural changes
   - "fix:" for bug fixes
5. Write clear commit message describing the change
6. NEVER commit if tests are failing or warnings exist

Small, frequent commits are preferred over large ones.

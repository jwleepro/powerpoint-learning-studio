# Red Phase - Write Failing Test

Write a failing test for the current feature:

1. Identify the smallest increment of functionality to test
2. Write a test with a meaningful name that describes the behavior
3. Make test failures clear and informative
4. Run the test to verify it fails with the expected message
5. Do NOT implement any production code yet

The test should be simple and focused on a single behavior.

# Refactor Phase - Improve Structure

Improve the code structure while keeping tests green:

1. Verify all tests are currently passing
2. Identify opportunities to:
   - Eliminate duplication
   - Improve naming and clarity
   - Extract methods or classes
   - Make dependencies explicit
3. Make ONE structural change at a time
4. Run tests after EACH change
5. Only proceed if tests remain green

This is STRUCTURAL change only - no behavioral changes.

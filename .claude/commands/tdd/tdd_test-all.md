# Run All Tests

Run the complete test suite (excluding long-running tests):

1. Execute all unit tests
2. Report any failures clearly
3. Show test coverage if available
4. Identify any warnings or issues
5. Confirm if we're in Green phase (all passing)

Use this frequently during TDD cycle to ensure code quality.

# TDD Status Check

Check current TDD cycle status:

1. Display current test status (passing/failing)
2. Show which phase we're in (Red/Green/Refactor)
3. List any uncommitted changes
4. Check for compiler/linter warnings
5. Show progress on current feature from plan.md
6. Identify what should be done next

Use this to orient yourself in the TDD workflow.
